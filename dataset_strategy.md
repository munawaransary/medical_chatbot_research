- **Coverage**: General medical conditions
- **Translation Priority**: High

#### Medical Chatbot Dataset (Sarfaraz)
- **Size**: ~50K medical conversations
- **Quality**: Conversational format
- **Coverage**: Symptom-based queries
- **Translation Priority**: Medium

### 2. Bengali Resources
#### BanglaHealth Dataset
- **Size**: 200K health paraphrases

## Translation Pipeline

### Stage 1: Automated Translation
```
English Medical Text → Google Translate API → Bengali Draft
```
- **Tools**: Google Translate API, Azure Translator
- **Quality Control**: Confidence scoring
- **Output**: Raw Bengali translations

### Stage 2: Medical Terminology Correction
```
Bengali Draft → Medical Term Mapping → Corrected Bengali
```
- **Process**: Replace generic terms with medical Bengali terms
- **Resources**: Bengali medical dictionaries
- **Validation**: Medical expert review

### Stage 3: Cultural Adaptation
```
Corrected Bengali → Cultural Context Addition → Final Bengali
```
- **Adaptations**:
  - Respectful address forms (আপনি instead of তুমি)
  - Cultural medical practices integration
  - Local disease terminology
  - Traditional medicine references where appropriate

### Stage 4: Quality Assurance
```
Final Bengali → Expert Review → Validated Dataset
```
- **Reviewers**: 3 medical professionals + 2 linguists
- **Criteria**: Medical accuracy + linguistic quality
- **Process**: Inter-annotator agreement measurement
